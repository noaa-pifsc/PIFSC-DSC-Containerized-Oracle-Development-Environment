_ rename the docker image to have a pifsc prefix instead of a noaa prefix
	_ rename the container names:
		X auto_db_app_deploy
		X db_container
		X ords_apex

X create a new script (custom_ prefix) to perform the actual custom db/apex deployments so it's easier to pull changes from upstream (it won't cause a conflict in the run_db_app_deployment.sh each time)








documentation:
	X docker container configuration is defined in .env file
		image names
		oracle password (defined the same for each admin -> SYSTEM, SYS, apex internal/admin, ORDS)
		APP_SCHEMA_NAME (checked for presence to determine the database has already been deployed)
		TARGET_APEX_VERSION
		
	X document the names of each container and what their function is
	
	X ORDS config (directory is mounted in container to allow changes via repo - custom project-level settings can be saved in version control)
		X settings.xml
	
	
	How to deploy
		Clone the repo
		
		
		run the docker container (e.g. bash build_deploy_project_dev.sh)
			automatically run the prepare script (to clone all dependencies within the working directory)
				For custom data system repos add the folders (e.g. DSC, CAS, etc.) and add entries to .gitignore so they aren't added to version control

		X identify all custom scripts that will change for custom projects
			X custom_prepare_docker_project.sh
			X custom_project_config.sh
			X custom_db_app_deploy.sh
			X custom_container_config.sh
			X .env
				
		





		
		
	X update the configuration documentation for new projects (fork and customize)
	
	
		
	
	
_ ** document the upstream pull process in the customization section of the documentation
	indicate which file updates to ignore (begins with custom_)
	
	.env must be merged since each use case will define a different APP_SCHEMA_NAME value
	
	Also document how the changes must be propagated through the fork dependency hierarchy
	
	_ look into how to implement the fork network in github (this can be transferred, but it is additional work)
		It's early on so it might be best to do this sooner than later -> this could be shared with other FMCs if they are interested in a similar generalized solution




_ test the different deployment/restart scenarios

	_ dev
		_ new deployment
		_ restart
		_ ords works (do a simple API setup and confirm we can pull the data)
	_ test (does not save database volume)
		_ new deployment
		_ ords works (do a simple API setup and confirm we can pull the data)
	
	_ ensure that we can save an APEX app and then import to OCI instances successfully
		_ test vice versa (OCI app imported into workspace)
	
	_ test with CAS or other app to ensure that the schemas are created successfully and the apex app is run successfully
		

X update the documentation to reference the authorization key instead of logging in to oracle container registry with the username/password


X Update the versions of Oracle XE and ORDS in this repo and then allow the downstream repos to pull those changes to propagate the changes
	X dockerfile now allows .env configuration file to specify the version of oracle xe, ords, and apex



_ look into the DB/APEX configuration files from DBA


X VS Code can be used for markdown

X document the login to oracle registry

X remove traceroute from dockerfile

X update the ords-developer image (implement dockerfile) to copy the conn_string.txt file into the appropriate folder so it doesn't disappear each time the container is run
	X uses .env file instead
		X set password, ports, etc. in ENV file

_ pull the upstream README.md changes into the repo



_ ** ORDS_PWD environment variable for ORDS configuration?
	** Ensure that ORDS is setup correctly for those types of projects (e.g. ORDS API for web app)
	"INFO : ORDS_PWD env var is not set, using generated value"

git bash commands:

	cd /c/Users/jesse.abdul/Documents/Version\ Control/Git/pifsc-oracle-developer-environment/deployment_scripts
	
	docker compose -f ../docker/docker-compose-dev.yml down
	docker volume rm apex-static-vol
	docker volume rm db-vol
	

	bash build_deploy_project_dev.sh

troubleshooting tips:
	If the project is not working as expected when it is prepared using prepare_docker_project.sh:
		for dev: is the correct branch being specified in the ODE or resource (e.g. DSC, CAS) URL?
		Is the branch spelled correctly?
	Is the project_config.sh correct?
		Does it point at a different project_folder_name than the prepared directory?
		
		


	_ Issue with the image not being able to download from the container registry
		_ submit SCR to allow PIFSC network (hardwired and VPN) to access container-registry.oracle.com



	
X Provide 2 different configurations:
	X persistent data (for development sessions)
		as DB data model is adjusted during development and APEX app is being developed/adjusted/tested
	X non-persistent data (for CI/CD or testing deployment database)
	
	

X Preparation script
	X How do we leverage the existing Git projects?
		X Git clone the repo(s) and copy the SQL folder contents into appropriate subfolders (e.g. DSC, CAS, CCD, etc.)
	
	X Provide a default script (e.g. run_db_app_deployments.sh)	in the docker container that can be customized to execute specific scripts in the container
		
To do:
	Documentation:
		X How to prepare the projects
		X The requirements of any shared database schemas that need to be included in a given Oracle data system
		X How to fork and customize the project
		
	
	_ build out the DSC example first
		_ get an export of all objects in the DSC schema from production
	_ build out the CAS example next
	_ build out the PARR Tools example next
	_ Then build out the generalized upstream repo that can be forked for any given data system and that the upstream changes can be pulled moving forward
	_ fork the generalized docker stack repo to create the DSC and CAS repos

	** X when we check if the schemas have been deployed, simply query to see if the expected schema exists or not, if not then run all of the deployment scripts if so just shutdown the container


	Run with database only?
		Maybe don't need that because any container scenario with an application would probably have some type of container attached to it for communication purposes
		We don't want to create every scenario of application server, it's not feasible or sensible
		
	for CI/CD purposes we would use a container with an appropriate programming language (e.g. PHP for PHPUnit)
		For testing we would want to look into PL/SQL unit testing framework so we can code coverage statistics
